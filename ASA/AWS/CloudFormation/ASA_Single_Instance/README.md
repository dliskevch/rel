## Deployment Procedure

1. Clone or Download the Repository
2. Review or change the values in the template file `ASA_Single_Instances_AZ.json`. It might be set during deployment creation.
3. Upload template file to S3
  Go to [S3 console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home), select your bucket, make folders if needed and click Upload and upload the template file.

  Get the Object URL from the page as show below which is needed in the next step.
4. Head to the [cloudformation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home)

5. Create a new stack with new resources

6. Keep the defaults and paste in the S3 object URL copied in the last step.

7. Enter a stack name and proceed to fill in the parameters. The ones needed at minimum are Availability zone and KeyName (used to SSH into the ASA).

8. Hit next, specify any tags if needed and hit next.

9. Review, Acknowledge the below and hit Create Stack to begin the stack initialzation:

## Prerequisites

### 1. Deploy Count Macro

In order to deploy these cloud formation templates, `Count macro` shoul be installed in your AWS account. Please find the installation procedure [here](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/aws-cloudformation-macros/tree/master/Count).  

The number of ASAv instance can range from two to five (both inclusive). One FMC instance is deployed if selected.

### 2. Change the count in the yaml file based on the number of ASAv instances required

Search for `# Change` throughout the yaml and correct the line above for the correct count required. Default is 3.

```yaml
  eipASAMgmt:
    Type: 'AWS::EC2::EIP'
    Properties:
      Domain: !Ref vpc
      Tags:
        - Key: TestKey
          Value: my bucket %d
    Count: 3
    # Change the count based on the number of ASAv instances.
```

```yaml

    # Change the count based on the number of ASAv instances.
```

    Count: 3
    # Change the count based on the number of ASAv instances.
```

This one can be done either here or on the cloudformation UI:

```yaml
NumberOfAsa:
    Description: Number of ASAv instances needed
    Type: Number
    Default: 3
    # Change the default count based on the number of ASAv instances here or in the Cloudformation UI when deploying
```

### 3. Upload the yaml to S3

Once done, upload the yaml to the S3 bucket. You can use the same bucket used for the Count macro or a new one.
Go to [S3 console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home), select your bucket, make folders if needed and click Upload and upload the yaml file.
![Bucket upload](images/bucket_upload.png)

Get the Object URL from the page as show below which is needed in the next step:
![Bucket Object URL](images/bucket_template.png)

## Deploying the template

1. Head to the [cloudformation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home)

2. Create a new stack with new resources

3. Keep the defaults and paste in the S3 object URL copied in the last step
![Stack template](images/stack_template.png)

4. Enter a stack name and proceed to fill in the parameters. The one needed at minimum is the KeyName (used to SSH into the ASA).
![Stack configuration](images/stack_config.png)

5. Hit next, specify any tags if needed and hit next.

6. Review, Acknowledge the below and hit Create Stack to begin the stack initialzation:

>I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might require the following capability: CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND

## Post deployment steps

* Wait for the EC2 instances to fully come up, ensure that they are indeed in different AZ.
![EC2 instances initializing](images/EC2_initialize.png)

* Validate the presence of a load balancer and the target group with the name as the hostname of the ASA. The target group will be unhealthy until the port specified is opened on the ASAs.
![Unhealthy target group](images/target_groups_unhealthy.png)

* Validate that the EC2 instances are up and accessible over SSH
  * You can use the command `ssh -i /path/to/keypair.pem admin@<asa_elastic_ip>`

* Perform day one configuration, setting passwords, configuring interfaces, ACLs and twice NAT. All interfaces can be configured for DHCP and they will use the IPs shown on the AWS EC2 console

* Once the ports are open and forwarded to your application, the target groups should show the endpoints as healthy.
![Healthy target group](images/target_groups_healthy.png)

* Grab the loadbalancer's DNS name and proceed to access the same. Your application should be available now, protected by Cisco ASAs.
